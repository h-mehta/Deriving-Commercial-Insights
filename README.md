# Deriving-Commercial-Insights
 
A global superstore spread across 7 markets is analysing data in respect of profit, sales, discount, shipping cost in order to gain insights into the most profitable regions/product lines to maximize its profits.

To understand the main revenue streams of the global superstore, various types of analysis like country analysis, market analysis and sub-category analysis were performed. Armed with knowledge of  centres of profit generation, a logical subsequent step was to probe the loss making centres. 

Market Analysis revealed that APAC with profit of approx. 436,000 is the most profitable market for the superstore. This begs the question, what strategy is being followed in APAC that makes it so profitable or is it just a case of more sales (due to population) translating into more profits?   

To probe the APAC market, the performance of regions and sub-categories was evaluated. This revealed that a huge chunk of APAC sales are attributable to the economic power houses of Asia, i.e. India and China. However, even in the most profitable market (i.e. APAC), there are some countries that are making losses consistently. The reasons for losses in these countries were probed. Necessary  recommendations have been made on how to convert these loss making regions to profit making.

It was also noted that the table-sub category is the only loss making sub-category in APAC (as well as globally). The reasons for the same were analysed and steps have been recommended – whether to discontinue or alter discount rates – on the basis of prevailing market conditions.
